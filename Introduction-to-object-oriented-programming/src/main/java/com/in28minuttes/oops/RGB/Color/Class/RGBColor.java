/*
* Coding Exercise: RGB Color Class
The Red-Green-Blue (RGB) model is a popular way to represent colors in computer systems. In this model, each color is represented as a combination of the primary colors red, green, and blue. Each of these primary colors can have intensity values ranging from 0 to 255.

In this exercise, you are tasked with completing the RGBColor class that models a color in the RGB model. The class has fields for the red, green, and blue intensities, and methods to get these values.

Additionally, there's an invert method that changes the color to its complementary color (the inverse color on a color wheel).

You need to implement the constructor, the getter methods for the red, green, and blue values, and the invert method.

The invert method should subtract the current intensity value of each primary color from 255 to get the inverted color.

Please follow the provided skeleton code and fill in the missing parts.

Instructions

Start by implementing the constructor of the RGBColor class. The constructor should take three arguments: red, green, and blue. These should be used to initialize the red, green, and blue fields of the class.

Implement the getRed, getGreen, and getBlue methods. These methods should return the current values of the red, green, and blue fields respectively.

Implement the invert method. This method should subtract the current value of each of the red, green, and blue fields from 255, and assign the result back to the respective field.

Examples

Below are three examples of creating an RGBColor object, getting the red, green, and blue values, and inverting the color.

Example 1

RGBColor color = new RGBColor(255, 0, 0);
System.out.println(color.getRed());   // Prints: 255
System.out.println(color.getGreen()); // Prints: 0
System.out.println(color.getBlue());  // Prints: 0
color.invert();
System.out.println(color.getRed());   // Prints: 0
System.out.println(color.getGreen()); // Prints: 255
System.out.println(color.getBlue());  // Prints: 255
Example 2

RGBColor color = new RGBColor(0, 255, 0);
color.invert();
System.out.println(color.getGreen()); // Prints: 0
Example 3

RGBColor color = new RGBColor(128, 128, 128);
color.invert();
System.out.println(color.getRed());   // Prints: 127
System.out.println(color.getGreen()); // Prints: 127
System.out.println(color.getBlue());  // Prints: 127
