/*
* Coding Exercise: Weather Advisor
In this problem, you have to complete the implementation of a WeatherAdviser class in Java that provides advice on what to wear based on the current temperature.

Here is the skeleton of the WeatherAdviser class:

public class WeatherAdviser {

    public String provideWeatherAdvisory(int temperature) {
        // TODO: Provide a weather advisory message based on the temperature.
        return "";
    }
}
Task

Your task is to implement the provideWeatherAdvisory(int temperature) method in the WeatherAdviser class.

provideWeatherAdvisory(int temperature) - This method will take one parameter, temperature (an integer), and it should return a String containing advice on what to wear according to the following guidelines:

If the temperature is less than 0, return "It's freezing! Wear a heavy coat."

If the temperature is between 0 and 10, inclusive, return "It's cold! Bundle up."

If the temperature is between 11 and 20, inclusive, return "It's cool! A light jacket will do."

If the temperature is above 20, return "It's warm! Enjoy the day."

Examples

Here are some examples of how your WeatherAdviser class should behave once implemented:

WeatherAdviser adviser = new WeatherAdviser();

System.out.println(adviser.provideWeatherAdvisory(-5));
// Output: "It's freezing! Wear a heavy coat."

System.out.println(adviser.provideWeatherAdvisory(5));
// Output: "It's cold! Bundle up."

System.out.println(adviser.provideWeatherAdvisory(15));
// Output: "It's cool! A light jacket will do."

System.out.println(adviser.provideWeatherAdvisory(25));
// Output: "It's warm! Enjoy the day."
Good luck!
